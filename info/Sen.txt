Sentinels were Valorant's first ever champions winning 2021 masters without losing a single map and 3-0'ing fnatic in the grand finals. 
Sentinels were unstoppable in the very beginning on Val but they couldn't perform in 2022 or 2023 but Sen looks really strong coming in 2024. Can they dominate again?
